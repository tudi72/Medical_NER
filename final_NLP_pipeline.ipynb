    "The Mental Health Corpus is a collection of texts related to people with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The corpus consists of two columns: one containing the comments, and the other containing labels indicating whether the comments are considered poisonous or not. The corpus can be used for a variety of purposes, such as sentiment analysis, toxic language detection, and mental health language analysis. The data in the corpus may be useful for researchers, mental health professionals, and others interested in understanding the language and sentiment surrounding mental health issues."

In this initial variant, the pipeline is limited to tokenization. While tokenizing alone does not provide deep insights into the underlying text, the TFDs still reveal notable differences between the two classes. The non-toxic class features frequent words such as 'like' , 'good' , 'film' , 'time' , 'feel' , 'love' , and 'life' , which generally convey a positive tone. In contrast, the toxic class shows words like 'feel' , 'life' , 'can’t' , 'people' , 'time' , 'never' , 'don’t' , 'much' , 'friends' , and 'anymore' , reflecting a more negative or distressing context."

    "In the second variant, the pipeline includes an additional normalization stage alongside tokenization. The purpose of this stage is to lowercase the text and apply either lemmatization or stemming. In our case, we applied lemmatization to both corpora. By converting the text to lowercase, identical words are merged, increasing word frequency and reducing redundancy since case sensitivity is no longer a factor. Similarly, lemmatization reduces words to their base form, grouping variations together. While the contextual differences between this variant and the initial one are not significant, there are still notable distinctions between the classes. In the non-toxic class, the top 30 most frequent words include 'like' , 'film' , 'movie' , 'filler' , 'people' , 'good' , 'really' , 'day' , and 'friend' , which suggest a generally positive context. Conversely, in the toxic class, frequent words such as 'feel' , 'life' , 'even' , 'can’t' , 'would' , 'one' , 'people' , 'friend' , 'go' , 'think' , 'never' , and 'don’t' , suggest a more negative or distressed tone."

    "In the final variant, the pipeline includes an additional filtering stage alongside tokenization and normalization. The goal of this stage is to exclude stopwords and punctuation, such as 'it' and 'me,' which are no longer visible in the plots, as they do not add value to the text analysis. In the non-toxic class, the top 30 most frequent words include 'like,' 'film,' 'movie,' 'people,' 'good,' 'really,' 'want,' 'day,' and 'friend,' suggesting that the text may generally have a positive context. On the other hand, in the toxic class, frequent words such as 'feel,' 'life,' 'even,' 'can’t,' 'never,' 'much,' 'help,' 'thought,' and 'anymore' suggest a more negative tone."

    "\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis: Extracted entities like \"SYMPTOM\" or \"DISEASE\" can provide context for sentiment classification.\n",
    "* Classification: Entities (e.g., \"anxiety\") can enhance identifying positive or negative conversations based on topic relevance.\n",
    "* Search/Tagging: Extracted entities enable tagging comments (e.g., \"related to therapy\") or improving search accuracy for key topics.\n",
    "* Clusterization: Comments can be grouped based on shared entities, such as \"TREATMENT\" or \"SYMPTOM\", revealing patterns."
